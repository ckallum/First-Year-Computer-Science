This program print's out all the pythagorean triples upto a given input number. eg. typing ./pTriple 24
in the terminal should output:

3, 4, 5
8, 6, 10
5, 12, 13
15, 8, 17
12, 16, 20

If nothing is passed in as an input argument then the program should run specified tests using the
assert function. If all tests pass then the program should print "Success". If an input is invalid,
the program will not print anything.

The program shouldn't need any extra libraries that weren't already given for the triangle program task.
