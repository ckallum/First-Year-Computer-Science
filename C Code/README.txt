This is a Huffman Coding program. It includes a simple way for the user to interact with the
program, where the user inputs how many characters they want to code, the characters
they want to encode(input one at a time) and the corresponding frequencies(one at a time)
in ascending order. There is some guards that make sure the input is in the correct format, eg
there has to be more than one character to be encoded and the frequencies inputed have to be in
ascending order.
There isn't any testing because I didn't know how to implement it but the output should
be enough to know that the program is working. Also the 'list' is techincally a queue.
There's also a header file you need to have for the program to work called "Huffman.h".
This is for the functions to work.
