  This is a simple program that takes a string as an input and outputs the longest
  substring in the string that is in alphabetical order. The tests are there to make sure
  that the input is in the correct format(should output "Input is Invalid" if the input has a
  character that isn't in the English alphabet). To check if all tests pass you should type "./StringEvaluation"
  The reasons for printing "Start at Index:" and "Length:" was to primarily verify that my logic is correct
  when finding the alphabetical substring. "Start at Index" signifies the index of the inputed string  
  that the substring starts at. The "Length" is simply the length of the string.
    I've found out that I could've used dynamic
  programming and vectors to make the program more efficient but I didn't have enough time
  to implement/learn how to use it.
