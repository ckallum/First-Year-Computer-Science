This is a Huffman Coding program. It includes a simple way for the user to interact with the
program, where the user inputs how many characters they want to code, the characters
they want to encode(input one at a time) and the corresponding frequencies in ascending order.
There is some guards that make sure the input is in the correct format. However, I didn't
manage to implement a way to prevent the user from inputing a character instead of
a number. There isn't any testing because I didn't know how to implement it but the output should
be enough to know that the program is working. Also the 'list' is techincally a queue.
There's also a header file you need to have for the program to work called "Huffman.h".
This is for the functions to work.
