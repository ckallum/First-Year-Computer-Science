This is a hash program implemented with the Java hash function and
chaining using singly linked lists to handle conflicts. I implemented
tests to verify that each of the functions work. You can see when
running the program the text is from the testing of the print function
which also hopefully visualises what's happening in the hash table.
All tests pass.
